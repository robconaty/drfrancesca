<p><i>Thank you a number of my clients who have kindly texted me their thoughts and feelings surrounding mental health. This is part of a series of original writing, artworks, and photography, which I'll be sharing throughout Mental Health Awareness Week, 2021. Thank you to the authors for your kind permission to share this content.</i></p>

<p>"For me personally, the events that took place over the last year and a bit took a toll on my mental well-being. The lockdowns we were in helped save countless lives in the face of a global enemy - Covid-19. But the inability to see and hug loved ones, plan for the future, and be stuck in the same space for weeks was very hard. It made me feel hopeless at times,  lack motivation, and even anxious when having the ability to go out again. I've seen the same feelings experienced by friends and family. Mental health occurs on a spectrum, and events such as the Covid-19 pandemic show us that anyone can struggle in terms of their mental well-being."</p>

<p>"The worst part about struggling with my mental health is the fear of being judged or stigmatised. This should never be the case."</p>
