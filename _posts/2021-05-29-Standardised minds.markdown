During this crucial time of GCSEs, A-levels and university exams many of my patients talk about their increasing anxiety, and I have been reflecting on standardised minds with the help of Albert Einstein.

On 17 May 1921 Thomas Edison gave Albert Einstein a standardised test (the same test he gave to employees) and he failed it!

Einstein explained that he didn’t know the speed of sound because...

“[I do not] carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books… The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think.”

100 years later what has changed?

Standardised tests are still largely used in education! With the internet era and with easier access to information, students really no longer need to know facts. Students simply need to know to access information and apply it!

Is it finally time to reorientate education towards learning how to think rather than simply learning?
