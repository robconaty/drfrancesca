I'd like to thank a client of mine for recently sharing this lovely feedback about <a href="https://drfrancesca.co.uk/2020/05/25/Try-mirror-therapy.html">mirror therapy</a>. You know who you are!

"When I started mirror therapy, a few months ago, my initial response to looking at myself in the mirror was that I saw someone who looked old, stressed, worn-out and dependent. I didn't really feel any love for that person but felt sorry for him. During today's mirror therapy, however, I saw someone who looked quite different: strong, confident and independent. I felt that I really loved and respected the person. A transformation!"

Mirror therapy can help you to re-connect with and to feel close to yourself. My clients often tell me that, through mirror therapy, they have been able to look at themselves in a compassionate, benevolent and non-critical way for the first time, just as they would with their best friend.
