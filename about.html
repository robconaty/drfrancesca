    <h3 id="welcome"><br></br>My bio</h3><br></br>

      <p class="biography">I am a clinical psychologist who has worked in the field of mental health since 2004. I have been working with families, children and adults who have presented with moderate to severe mental health difficulties and emotional distress. I am also interested in trauma and the treatment of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. </p>

      <p class="biography">Over the years, I've supported young people and adults with histories involving early traumas, abuse and neglect. I am qualified in assessing and treating anxiety, depression, personality disorders, eating disorders, attachment disorders and broken relationships. 
      </p>

      <p class="biography"> 
      I am trained in several therapeutic models including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Behaviour Family Therapy (BFT). </p>

      <p class="biography">I have recently trained in Mindful Interbeing Mirror Therapy (MIMT) which is a new and revolutionary psychotherapy in which both therapist and patient work in front of the mirror with the aim of rebuilding a cohesive Self.
      </p>
      <br>
      

      <h3 id="welcome">Why I started my practice</h3><br></br>
      <p class="biography">Everyone deserves to lead a life worth-living.</p>

      <p class="biography">In life and in my clinical practice, it's clear to me that anybody can go through times when despair, shame, anger and sadness seem overwhelming. At such times, it's easy to feel lonely, hopeless, lost, invisible and unlovable. 

        <p class="biography">These are very tough moments, but you are not alone.</p>

        <p class="biography">I offer a compassionate and caring environment. I will listen and help you to make sense of what is happening and to find the best means of managing difficulties and alleviating suffering.</p>
        
        <p class="biography">I look forward to working with you. <a href="Contact.html">Get in touch today.</a></p>
