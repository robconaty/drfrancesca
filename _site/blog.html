<p class="blogcopy">No one deserves your compassion more than you! </p>

<p class="blogcopy">Let’s start with the etymology of the word. The Latin root of compassion, is pati, which means 'to suffer'. The prefix, com-, means 'with'. In other words, 'to have compassion' means 'co-suffering' (to 'suffer with' ) and it involves feeling warmth, caring and the desire to help the suffering person in some way. Having compassion also means that you offer understanding and kindness to others when they make mistakes, rather than judging them harshly.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">
Compassion involves feeling moved by others’ suffering so that you respond to their pain.  So, the first step to have self-compassion is to notice that you are suffering and you are having a difficult time. If you can see your suffering rather than ignoring or criticising your pain then you will be able to be kind to yourself and  say 'this is really difficult for me right now. How can I care for myself in this moment?' 
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Perhaps having compassion for yourself means that you honour and accept you are a human and you will make mistakes, have limitations, experience losses. This is the human condition, a reality shared by all of us. 
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">5 tips to cultivate self-compassion</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Treat yourself as you would treat someone you really care about and you love unconditionally.
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Remember that you’re not alone.
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Remember that 'you are only human' and give yourself permission to be imperfect. 
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Accept that self-compassion is seeing your suffering and not self-Indulgence.
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Practice mindfulness.

<p><img src="/img/yoga.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>
<p class="blogdate">8 March 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">The clinic where I see clients started running yoga sessions. I went along last week and I haven’t shut up about the class I attended since then. 5 Tibetan Rites is a series of five yoga poses. The aim is to repeat the rites 21 times in one session, but you may want to build up to this. Far from being a fad, this form of yoga is estimated to be more than 2,500 year’s old.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">The good thing about a short, effective exercise like this into your daily routine is that it can quickly become as much a part of your day as brushing your teeth. Not only will this benefit your physical health, it will also help to improve your sleep, reduce anxiety and improve your overall mental wellbeing.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">This kind of repetitive sequence is also very effective for those of you who are applying mindfulness techniques, as it will help you to re-focus on the here and now rather than on the distractions around us. </p>

<p class="blogdate">25 February 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">One of the first things I ask new clients is ‘how are you sleeping, lately?’ What’s interesting is how many people are surprised by the question. No one bats an eyelid when I ask about diet or exercise, but sleep? It seems like the idea that a lack of sleep might be wreaking havoc with our mental and physical wellbeing is the last thing many of us consider during difficult times in our lives. </p>

<p class="blogcopy">So, read Matthew Walker’s book ‘Why we sleep?’ to understand how sleep may be affecting your mood and your personal relationships and what you need to do (and not do) to get enough sleep and to improve the quality of your sleep. You’ll learn about:</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The impact of caffeine on your sleep patterns and how to limit this
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The negative consequences of certain types of lighting on your sleep
<p class="blogcopy">
-    How alcohol reduces the quality of your sleep 
<p class="blogcopy">
-    And why ‘power naps’ will never make up for insufficient night time sleep
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
You’ll also be surprised by what the book may tell you about your own experience of sleep and mood, for example why some of us are genuinely hardwired to be early risers, while others take a long time to wake up in the morning. 
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">It’s a truly eye-opening book, if I can put it like that.
