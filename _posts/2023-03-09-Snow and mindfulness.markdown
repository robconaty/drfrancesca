I love the snow! It inevitably changes things around us (including transport issues!) and I like to notice them. You can try to do this practice (one, some or all of the six steps listed below) by going outside or by sitting/standing by your window:

Observe/describe:

1. how does the snow make things look?
2. what does the snow smell like?
3. what does the snow taste like?
4. how does the snow make things sound?
5. how does the snow feel in your hands?
6. ...and if you are outside, how does the space feel around you?
