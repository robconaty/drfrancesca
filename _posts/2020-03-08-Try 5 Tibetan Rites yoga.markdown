The clinic where I see clients started running yoga sessions. I went along last week and I haven’t shut up about the class I attended since then. 5 Tibetan Rites is a series of five yoga poses. The aim is to repeat the rites 21 times in one session, but you may want to build up to this. Far from being a fad, this form of yoga is estimated to be more than 2,500 year’s old.

The good thing about a short, effective exercise like this into your daily routine is that it can quickly become as much a part of your day as brushing your teeth. Not only will this benefit your physical health, it will also help to improve your sleep, reduce anxiety and improve your overall mental wellbeing.

This kind of repetitive sequence is also very effective for those of you who are applying mindfulness techniques, as it will help you to re-focus on the here and now rather than on the distractions around us.
