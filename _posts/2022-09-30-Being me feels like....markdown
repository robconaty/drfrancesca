I asked one of my clients to describe how they feel about themself. After a long sigh, they explained that it was simply too hard to describe the nothingness and shapelessness they felt. 'The only word I can think of is ...frazzled.'

'Sounds frightening,' I said and we continued exploring this theme.

I asked them to observe what it feels like to be frazzled. In the following session, they showed me a beautiful animation they had created (shown here).

We are now working on building a cohesive sense of self with the use of the mirror (find out how <a href="https://drfrancesca.co.uk/2020/05/25/Try-mirror-therapy.html">Mindful Interbeing Mirror Therapy</a> could benefit you. ).
