<p><strong>How I took the first step to better mental health</strong></p>



<p>"It was very difficult for me to acknowledge that I needed help with my mental health. For the longest time I did not feel like I had the right to be mentally unwell, that my issues were not valid. It made me feel powerless and invisible. Reaching out and seeking help was the best thing I could do for myself - even though the voice in my head kept saying 'you dont have real problems, that's silly, noone is going to take you seriously, stop being dramatic, pull yourself together'. Seeking help and starting therapy will give you back your power and a sense of pride in showing up for that child in you who had so much bad happen to them. Make the first step and start healing. It will get better."</p>
