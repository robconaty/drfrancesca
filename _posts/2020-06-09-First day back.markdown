My son returned to school today and wasn't happy at all! The walk in was a rather difficult 10 minutes! He wasn't having it and I have really tried my best to validate his mixed emotions (and my mixed emotions too).

I definitely tried several skills including distraction (it was hard not to hear him though), regulating my breathing, accepting the situation as it is (my son is challenging me and it could not have been any different) and told myself 'it will pass'. When we finally arrived, the headteacher gave us a very warm welcome and he was still unhappy! At last, he saw one of his classmates in the distance and a big smile crossed his face! Then, half grinning he told me 'I still hate going to school,' but we both knew that he was going to be ok!


I am aware that  many children have been feeling lost during the lockdown. That's because routines, a sense of belonging, playing with peers and school settings are an essential part of life. Their absence is keenly felt, both in terms of their education and wellbeing.
