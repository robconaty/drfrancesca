<p><strong>My art and me</strong></p>



<p>"This was one of my first wet felted wool wall art projects Iâ€™ve done after being introduced to the technique. </p>

<p>After finishing it, it reminded me of one of the artists I met in Santa Barbara, California, when I used to work at the crafts market, making me notice that in most of my designs I was using circles.</p> <p>And since then, every time I draw or create something I notice all the circles I incorporate in my artistic work. Maybe represents who I am inside somehow? What does the circle symbolise?"</p>
