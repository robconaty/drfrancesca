<p><img src="/img/domesticviolence.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>

<p class="blogdate">08 April 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">‘I always approach him with great caution, as you would a caged lion!’  It’s an account that is especially familiar to many domestic violence victims right now, as they long for some time apart from their abusers once the Covid-19 lockdown ends.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Staying at home can be difficult and worrying for everyone and it can be a a dangerous nightmare for those living with abusers. Victims have reported how Covid-19 is used by their abusive partners to further control and abuse and it is impacting their access to services in the community such as shelter and psychological therapies. </p>

<p class="blogcopy">On 6 April, the charity Refuge announced that the national domestic abuse helpline saw a 25% increase in calls and online requests for help since the lockdown. More than 25 organisations helping domestic violence victims have reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the UK’s coronavirus epidemic. In China’s Hubei province, where the virus was first detected, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled during the lockdown in February.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">With the country shut down, victims may assume there’s nowhere to go for help. That’s not the case. It's important to know that you are not alone and helplines are working very hard to support you during this very difficult time.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">The Home Office has also published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-and-domestic-abuse"> guidance </a>for those experiencing or feel at risk of domestic abuse during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">As always, if you or someone else is in immediate danger please call 999 and ask for the police. Silent calls will work if you are not safe to speak – call 999 and then press 55.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">SafeLives has also published <a href="https://safelives.org.uk/staying-safe-during-covid-19-guidance">a guide for staying safe during COVID-19 for victims and survivors</a> with excellent practical advice.</p>

<p><img src="/img/greyscale-photography-of-woman-wearing-long-sleeved-top-736843.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>

<p class="blogdate">04 April 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Sometimes, the best way to overcoming your worries is to simply accept them.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Worrying is part of human nature. We can’t stop worrying as it helps to keep us alive! Worrying prepares us for action (to protect ourselves and others) when we see a threat.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">However, when worrying becomes too much we can stop functioning well. There are different strategies that we can learn to manage our worries to avoid being overwhelmed by them. Different approaches work best for different people; most of the time a combination of approaches may work best.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">When my clients talk about their worries in therapy, we first try different strategies to “change” them. Among other approaches, we might check the facts that maintain the worries, we might consider if they could be overestimating the threat or exaggerating the worries. However, sometimes change is not possible and this is when we move towards acceptance strategies.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Accepting worries can be a powerful strategy. Worries often diminish when we stop resisting them and instead acknowledge them. If you can’t stop worrying for any reason, accept it. Ask yourself what’s wrong with worrying for now. There are no rules that say we mustn’t worry! So embrace your worries and accept them if this seems the best approach for you right now.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Many worries many solutions…if you need help, we can find the right solution for you together. Get in touch.</p>

<p><img src="/img/COVID19.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>

<p class="blogdate">19 March 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">What is so scary about the Covid-19? 
 It’s spreading fast, there is not (yet) a vaccine or a preventative treatment, and we don’t know how deadly it actually is. We are human and when we are uncertain we react with fear.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Under uncertainty, we become very bad at spotting misinformation, in part because we don’t take the time to properly check the facts. But it’s also because our memories play tricks on us, encouraging us to believe things we read/hear repeatedly and to look for information that validates our preexisting beliefs.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">
The non-stop news enhances our hyper-vigilant state so that we notice more, and hear more, and read more, and interpret that in a threatening way. Human beings are hard-wired to respond to threats, to protect ourselves from real or perceived danger. But it’s really difficult to keep safe when the threat is so uncertain and potentially far-reaching. That’s where you start to see people take on more unusual behaviors (e.g. panic-buying, excessive avoidance, etc) which are not compatible with survival. 
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">We know from research and clinical experience that it is important that we do what we can to reassert a sense of control over our fears. There are very basic things that people can do to take back the power and control. Those include self-isolating and monitoring your temperature if you get sick; washing your hands regularly with soap and water; and staying away from  gatherings.
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Social support networks are crucial. It is very important that people who tend to be more anxious connect in a safe way with people in their lives who they trust and who they can turn to for support. This might be via social media or by singing from the balconies (like in Italy) when social isolation is a way to contain the spreading of he virus.  I really like the Italian '#unitedbutdistant' and '#wewillgothroughthis' as they highlight the importance of staying connected when we are required to stay apart for protective measure. </p>

<p><img src="/img/selfcompassion.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>

<p class="blogdate">10 March 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">No one deserves your compassion more than you! </p>

<p class="blogcopy">Let’s start with the etymology of the word. The Latin root of compassion, is pati, which means 'to suffer'. The prefix, com-, means 'with'. In other words, 'to have compassion' means 'co-suffering' (to 'suffer with' ) and it involves feeling warmth, caring and the desire to help the suffering person in some way. Having compassion also means that you offer understanding and kindness to others when they make mistakes, rather than judging them harshly.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">
Compassion involves feeling moved by others’ suffering so that you respond to their pain.  So, the first step to have self-compassion is to notice that you are suffering and you are having a difficult time. If you can see your suffering rather than ignoring or criticising your pain then you will be able to be kind to yourself and  say 'this is really difficult for me right now. How can I care for myself in this moment?' 
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">Perhaps having compassion for yourself means that you honour and accept you are a human and you will make mistakes, have limitations, experience losses. This is the human condition, a reality shared by all of us. 
</p>

<p class="blogcopy">5 tips to cultivate self-compassion</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Treat yourself as you would treat someone you really care about and you love unconditionally.
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Remember that you’re not alone.
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Remember that 'you are only human' and give yourself permission to be imperfect. 
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Accept that self-compassion is seeing your suffering and not self-Indulgence.
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    Practice mindfulness.

<p><img src="/img/yoga.jpg" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>
<p class="blogdate">8 March 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">The clinic where I see clients started running yoga sessions. I went along last week and I haven’t shut up about the class I attended since then. 5 Tibetan Rites is a series of five yoga poses. The aim is to repeat the rites 21 times in one session, but you may want to build up to this. Far from being a fad, this form of yoga is estimated to be more than 2,500 year’s old.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">The good thing about a short, effective exercise like this into your daily routine is that it can quickly become as much a part of your day as brushing your teeth. Not only will this benefit your physical health, it will also help to improve your sleep, reduce anxiety and improve your overall mental wellbeing.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">This kind of repetitive sequence is also very effective for those of you who are applying mindfulness techniques, as it will help you to re-focus on the here and now rather than on the distractions around us. </p>

<p><img src="/img/sleepingmonkey_x600.png" alt="image" class="image-class postimage" /></p>
<p class="blogdate">25 February 2020</p>

<p class="blogcopy">One of the first things I ask new clients is ‘how are you sleeping, lately?’ What’s interesting is how many people are surprised by the question. No one bats an eyelid when I ask about diet or exercise, but sleep? It seems like the idea that a lack of sleep might be wreaking havoc with our mental and physical wellbeing is the last thing many of us consider during difficult times in our lives. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p class="blogcopy">So, read Matthew Walker’s book ‘Why we sleep?’ to understand how sleep may be affecting your mood and your personal relationships and what you need to do (and not do) to get enough sleep and to improve the quality of your sleep. You’ll learn about:</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The impact of caffeine on your sleep patterns and how to limit this
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The negative consequences of certain types of lighting on your sleep
<p class="blogcopy">
-    How alcohol reduces the quality of your sleep 
<p class="blogcopy">
-    And why ‘power naps’ will never make up for insufficient night time sleep
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
You’ll also be surprised by what the book may tell you about your own experience of sleep and mood, for example why some of us are genuinely hardwired to be early risers, while others take a long time to wake up in the morning. 
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">It’s a truly eye-opening book, if I can put it like that.
