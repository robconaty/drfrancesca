<p><strong>In the Looking Glass</strong></p>



<p>Before, there was darkness in the mirror,</p>

<p>A deep dark vortex of sadness and fear,</p>

<p>Endless days of trudging, running and hiding,</p>

<p>No chance of the beauty in life me finding.</p>

<br>

<p>Now looking in the mirror I understand that I am not the darkness,</p>

<p>With help and compassion I can also see lightness.</p>

<br>

<p>A lightness I never thought I would ever see.</p>

<p>Joy seeps in and times of happiness slowly come to be.</p>

<br>

<p>Yes there are also times of sadness and fear and anger,</p>

<p>But in the looking glass I am beginning to see and be a kind, compassionate me.</p></p>

<br>

<p>I no longer avoid the looking glass nor want to escape through it,</p>

<p>Learning to nurture the past, the present and future me.</p>
