Today is a sad day for me as one of my closest aunts has passed away.

Sadness is a sign of grief, which is a consequence of losing someone or something we care about. In fact, we can say that sadness and love are intrinsically linked.

From my professional and personal experiences of loss, I have learned you cannot get around the pain of your grief.  Instead, you must open and gently embrace the pain. Paradoxically, the only way to lessen your pain is to move toward it, not away from it. Denying or suppressing your pain causes more suffering.

So... You can be sad and it is *necessary* to feel sad, because you have lost someone or something important.

The sadness also alerts others to the feelings inside you. Receiving and accepting support from others is an essential need during mourning. If you try to deny or hide your sadness, you are closing a door that leads to healing.

>"When your sorrow is comforted... you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend...I shall not leave you."
