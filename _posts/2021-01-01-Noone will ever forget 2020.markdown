One thing's for sure. Nobody will ever forget 2020.

We've been through a lot (and are still going through a lot) and we have experienced many strong emotions...

On New Year's Day, I am thinking about the best way to turn lemons into lemonade! No point in wishing for freshly squeezed orange juice if we only have lemons.

Bad things happen...that's life. Sometimes we catch those lemons and keep moving forward.  Other times we get overwhelmed with an abundance of them! When our arms are filled with far more lemons than we could ever hold, we feel stressed and too overwhelmed to remember that lemons can be turned into something incredible.

There’s wisdom in the proverb “when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”  Use the bitterness of adversity and turn it into something refreshing by...

1. Accept your lemons (life is full of challenges, you know that).

2. You have handed lemons before (you have been here before or in similar situations).

3. One lemon at a time!

4. Add water to your lemons - Dilute your sweet and sour mixture and replenish yourself by taking breaks, engaging in self-care activities, and receiving support from those around you.

5. Embrace the lemons - While lemons are sour, they are also a great source of Vitamin C, and just as your immune system is boosted by Vitamin C, so too is your mind boosted by life’s challenges.

6. Sit back and Learn. Once you’ve overcome a challenge take time to sit with it, to reflect on it, to learn from it and to grow from it.

Enjoy your lemonade!
