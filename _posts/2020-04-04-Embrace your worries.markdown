<p class="blogcopy">Sometimes, the best way to overcoming your worries is to simply accept them.</p> 

<p class="blogcopy">Worrying is part of human nature. We can’t stop worrying as it helps to keep us alive! Worrying prepares us for action (to protect ourselves and others) when we see a threat.</p> 

<p class="blogcopy">However, when worrying becomes too much we can stop functioning well. There are different strategies that we can learn to manage our worries to avoid being overwhelmed by them. Different approaches work best for different people; most of the time a combination of approaches may work best.</p>

<p class="blogcopy">When my clients talk about their worries in therapy, we first try different strategies to “change” them. Among other approaches, we might check the facts that maintain the worries, we might consider if they could be overestimating the threat or exaggerating the worries. However, sometimes change is not possible and this is when we move towards acceptance strategies.</p> 

<p class="blogcopy">Accepting worries can be a powerful strategy. Worries often diminish when we stop resisting them and instead acknowledge them. If you can’t stop worrying for any reason, accept it. Ask yourself what’s wrong with worrying for now. There are no rules that say we mustn’t worry! So embrace your worries and accept them if this seems the best approach for you right now.</p> 

<p class="blogcopy">Many worries many solutions…if you need help, we can find the right solution for you together. Get in touch.</p>
