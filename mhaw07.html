<p><strong>My art and me</strong></p>



<p>"This was one of my first wet felted wool wall art projects I’ve done after being introduced to the technique. </p>

<p>After finishing it, it reminded me of one of the artists I met in Santa Barbara, California, when I used to work at the crafts market, making me notice that in most of my designs I was using circles.</p> <p>And since then, every time I draw or create something I notice all the circles I incorporate in my artistic work. Maybe represents who I am inside somehow? What does the circle symbolise?</p>

<p>It was very difficult for me to acknowledge that I needed help with my mental health. For the longest time I did not feel like I had the right to be mentally unwell, that my issues were not valid. It made me feel powerless and invisible. Reaching out and seeking help was the best thing I could do for myself - even though the voice in my head kept saying 'You don’t have real problems. That’s silly. No one is going to take you seriously. Stop being dramatic. Pull yourself together.’ Seeking help and starting therapy will give you back your power and a sense of pride in showing up for that child in you who had so much bad happen to them. Make the first step and start healing. It will get better."</p>
