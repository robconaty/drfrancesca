<p class="blogcopy">One of the first things I ask new clients is ‘how are you sleeping, lately?’ What’s interesting is how many people are surprised by the question. No one bats an eyelid when I ask about diet or exercise, but sleep? It seems like the idea that a lack of sleep might be wreaking havoc with our mental and physical wellbeing is the last thing many of us consider during difficult times in our lives. </p>

<p class="blogcopy">So, read Matthew Walker’s book ‘Why we sleep?’ to understand how sleep may be affecting your mood and your personal relationships and what you need to do (and not do) to get enough sleep and to improve the quality of your sleep. You’ll learn about:</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The impact of caffeine on your sleep patterns and how to limit this
<p class="blogcopy">
-    The negative consequences of certain types of lighting on your sleep
<p class="blogcopy">
-    How alcohol reduces the quality of your sleep 
<p class="blogcopy">
-    And why ‘power naps’ will never make up for insufficient night time sleep
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">
You’ll also be surprised by what the book may tell you about your own experience of sleep and mood, for example why some of us are genuinely hardwired to be early risers, while others take a long time to wake up in the morning. 
</p>
<p class="blogcopy">It’s a truly eye-opening book, if I can put it like that.
