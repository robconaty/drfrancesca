Iâ€™ll be offering a new specialist service for male victims of domestic violence.  This will include evening groups and individual psychological therapy, starting from October 2020.

<strong>Why am I doing it?</strong>

According to the <a href="https://www.mankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/50-Key-Facts-about-Male-Victims-of-Domestic-Abuse-and-Partner-Abuse-March-2020-final.pdf">ManKind initiative</a> 13.6% of men and 28.4% of women aged 16 to 74 have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16 (2017/18), equivalent to an estimated 2.9 million male victims and 6 million female. So, for every three victims of domestic abuse, two will be female, one will be male. One in four women and one in six to seven men suffer from domestic abuse in their lifetime. 

Furthermore, nearly half of male victims fail to tell anyone they are a victim of domestic abuse (only 51% tell anyone). They are nearly three times less likely to tell anyone than a female victim (49% of men tell no one as opposed to 19% women). 20% of the men told to a psychologist/therapist and 43% to someone that they know personally like a family member or a friend, and only 15% reported to the police.

The figures highlight a silent minority of male victims, which mirrors what I am seeing in my psychological therapy clinic. 

If you are a man affected by domestic violence, you may have noticed that there are very few psychology or psychotherapy services offering specialised support.
