<p><strong>Laura’s Poem (6/7/13)</strong></p>





<p>A cloak of grey,</p>
<p>A sky of black,</p>
<p>She sees no light,</p>
<p>Sees no way back.</p>
<br>
<p>To the girl that she was</p>
<p>Before hope was gone.</p>
<p>When her future held promise</p>
<p>And her inner light shone.</p>
<br>
<p>Her mind is four walls</p>
<p>That close in around her.</p>
<p>A moment of freedom,</p>
<p>Soon consumed by pressure.</p>
<br>
<p>By guilt because she can’t</p>
<p>Control the thoughts inside.</p>
<p>The feelings that rule her,</p>
<p>From which she cannot hide.</p>
<br>
<p>She can’t see her worth,</p>
<p>Though she’s the only one,</p>
<p>Thinks that life would be better</p>
<p>If there simply was none.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s hard to discern</p>
<p>And she feels so alone</p>
<p>But her family stands by</p>
<p>She is not on her own.</p>
<br>
<p>We all see the truth,</p>
<p>Soon to be unfurled,</p>
<p>She just hasn’t yet found</p>
<p>Her place in the World.</p>
